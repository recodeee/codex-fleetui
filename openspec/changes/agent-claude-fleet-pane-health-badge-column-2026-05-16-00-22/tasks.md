## Definition of Done

This change is complete only when **all** of the following are true:

- Every checkbox below is checked.
- The agent branch reaches `MERGED` state on `origin` and the PR URL + state are recorded in the completion handoff.
- If any step blocks (test failure, conflict, ambiguous result), append a `BLOCKED:` line under section 4 explaining the blocker and **STOP**. Do not tick remaining cleanup boxes; do not silently skip the cleanup pipeline.

## Handoff

- Handoff: change=`agent-claude-fleet-pane-health-badge-column-2026-05-16-00-22`; branch=`agent/<your-name>/<branch-slug>`; scope=`TODO`; action=`continue this sandbox or finish cleanup after a usage-limit/manual takeover`.
- Copy prompt: Continue `agent-claude-fleet-pane-health-badge-column-2026-05-16-00-22` on branch `agent/<your-name>/<branch-slug>`. Work inside the existing sandbox, review `openspec/changes/agent-claude-fleet-pane-health-badge-column-2026-05-16-00-22/tasks.md`, continue from the current state instead of creating a new sandbox, and when the work is done run `gx branch finish --branch agent/<your-name>/<branch-slug> --base dev --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup`.

## 1. Specification

- [x] 1.1 Finalize proposal scope and acceptance criteria for `agent-claude-fleet-pane-health-badge-column-2026-05-16-00-22`.
- [x] 1.2 Define normative requirements in `specs/fleet-pane-health-badge-column/spec.md`.

## 2. Implementation

- [x] 2.1 Implement scoped behavior changes (AgentKind classifier, KIND column, `g` toggle, footer state).
- [x] 2.2 Add/update focused regression coverage (5 classifier/grouping unit tests + 2 ratatui `TestBackend` render tests).

## 3. Verification

- [x] 3.1 `cargo test -p fleet-pane-health` → 10 passed, 0 failed.
- [x] 3.2 Live verification: respawn the `viz` tmux window with the patched binary, confirm `CODX`/`CLAU` badges render and `g` toggles `── group: codex ──` headers.
- [x] 3.3 Run `openspec validate agent-claude-fleet-pane-health-badge-column-2026-05-16-00-22 --type change --strict` → `Change ... is valid`.
- [x] 3.4 Run `openspec validate --specs` → `No items found to validate` (no archived specs in this repo yet).

## 4. Cleanup (mandatory; run before claiming completion)

- [ ] 4.1 Run the cleanup pipeline: `gx branch finish --branch agent/<your-name>/<branch-slug> --base dev --via-pr --wait-for-merge --cleanup`. This handles commit -> push -> PR create -> merge wait -> worktree prune in one invocation.
- [ ] 4.2 Record the PR URL and final merge state (`MERGED`) in the completion handoff.
- [ ] 4.3 Confirm the sandbox worktree is gone (`git worktree list` no longer shows the agent path; `git branch -a` shows no surviving local/remote refs for the branch).
